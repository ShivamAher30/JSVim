# Enhanced Syntax Highlighting Integration

## Changes Made

1. **Integrated Enhanced Syntax Highlighter**:
   - Updated references in `editor.js` and `index.js` to use the enhanced syntax highlighter
   - The enhanced highlighter provides better language support and performance

2. **Improved Language Detection**:
   - Added content-based language detection with shebang line recognition
   - Enhanced file extension mappings for 30+ languages
   - Added intelligent fallback detection for when file extension isn't available

3. **Performance Optimizations**:
   - Added caching mechanism for tokens and highlighted lines
   - Implemented special handling for large files to maintain editor responsiveness
   - Added simplified highlighting for very large files

4. **Added More Themes**:
   - Dracula (default)
   - Nord
   - Tokyo Night
   - One Dark
   - Solarized

5. **Updated Documentation**:
   - Enhanced the README.md with new syntax highlighting information
   - Added theme documentation and usage instructions
   - Created a syntax highlighting test file

## Technical Details

The enhanced syntax highlighter uses highlight.js for the base syntax highlighting but adds several important features:

1. **Comprehensive Language Coverage**:
   - JavaScript/TypeScript with modern syntax
   - Python with all keywords and built-ins
   - C/C++/Java with proper type highlighting
   - HTML/CSS with attribute highlighting
   - Many other languages with specific token handling

2. **Token Classification**:
   - Keywords and control flow tokens
   - Strings, numbers, and literals
   - Comments (single-line, multi-line, doc comments)
   - Functions, classes, and their declarations
   - Variables and types
   - Language-specific tokens

3. **Performance Techniques**:
   - Caching for repeated tokens and lines
   - Memory management to prevent cache overflow
   - Progressive rendering for large files
   - Throttled rendering for very large files

## Testing

1. Created a test file: `test-syntax.js` that verifies:
   - Language detection from extensions and filenames
   - Theme switching functionality
   - Highlighting of JavaScript code

2. Added a test command to package.json:
   - Run with `npm test` to verify highlighter functionality

## Future Improvements

- Add more language-specific token handling for specialized languages
- Implement additional performance optimizations for extremely large files
- Support user-defined custom themes
- Add more detailed language statistics in the status bar
