ðŸŽ‰ VimJS AI Suggestion Fixes Demo
=================================

âœ… FIXED ISSUES:

1. ðŸ”§ Character Rendering Problems:
   â€¢ HTML tags (like <span class="hljs-function">) are now stripped
   â€¢ ANSI color codes ([38;2;248;242m) are removed
   â€¢ Special Unicode characters (â”‚) are replaced with safe alternatives
   â€¢ All suggestions are now plain text only

2. ðŸ‘» Ghost Text Visibility:
   â€¢ AI suggestions now appear as clearly visible dim gray text
   â€¢ Ghost text is inserted BEFORE syntax highlighting (prevents conflicts)
   â€¢ Better contrast with hex color #666666 for visibility
   â€¢ Proper handling of cursor positioning with previews

3. âš¡ Improved AI Flow:
   â€¢ Debounce reduced to 300ms for better responsiveness
   â€¢ AI suggestions are sanitized before display
   â€¢ Clear preview dismissal on ESC, mode changes, or cursor movement
   â€¢ Better Tab acceptance behavior

4. ðŸŽ¯ Enhanced UX:
   â€¢ Ghost text appears inline at cursor position
   â€¢ Typing continues to dismiss and re-trigger suggestions
   â€¢ No interference with normal typing flow
   â€¢ Visual feedback for AI suggestion availability

ðŸ“– CORRECT BEHAVIOR FLOW:

1. User types in Insert Mode
2. After 300ms delay, send context to Groq API
3. Groq returns plain text completion
4. Show completion as dim gray ghost text after cursor
5. User presses Tab â†’ Accept and insert suggestion
6. User keeps typing â†’ Dismiss current, trigger new suggestion
7. User presses ESC/moves cursor â†’ Hide ghost text

ðŸš€ Ready to test? Try:
   vimjs test-ai-enhanced.js

Then:
   â€¢ Press 'i' to enter Insert mode
   â€¢ Type "console.lo" and wait 300ms
   â€¢ You should see ghost text like "g('Hello World');"
   â€¢ Press Tab to accept, or keep typing to dismiss

ðŸ”§ All character rendering issues have been resolved!
