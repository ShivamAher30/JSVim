## Installation

Install globally from npm:

```bash
npm install -g vimjs
```

Or install from the repository:

```bash

npm install
npm link
```

### AI Autocompletion Setup

To enable AI-powered code autocompletion:

1. Get a free API key from [Groq Console](https://console.groq.com/keys)
2. Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env`:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
3. Edit `.env` and add your Groq API key:
   ```
   GROQ_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
   ```

## Usage

```bash
# Open a file (creates it if doesn't exist)
vimjs filename.txt

# Open untitled buffer
vimjs
```

## AI-Powered Code Autocompletion

VimJS now includes intelligent code autocompletion powered by Groq's large language models.

### Features

- **Context-aware suggestions**: Analyzes up to 100 lines or 1000 characters before the cursor
- **Multi-language support**: Works with any programming language
- **Smart caching**: Caches recent completions for faster responses
- **Multiple models**: Support for Mixtral, LLaMA3, and other Groq models
- **Graceful error handling**: Handles rate limits, timeouts, and network issues

### Usage

1. **Setup**: Configure your Groq API key in the `.env` file
2. **Autocompletion**: In Insert mode, press `Tab` to get AI suggestions
3. **Toggle**: Use `:toggleAI` to enable/disable the feature
4. **Status**: Use `:ai` to check configuration and status
5. **Models**: Use `:aimodel <model-name>` to switch between models

### Supported Models

- `mixtral-8x7b-32768` (default) - Excellent for code completion
- `llama3-8b-8192` - Fast and efficient
- `llama3-70b-8192` - Most capable but slower
- `gemma-7b-it` - Good balance of speed and quality

### Status Messages

- `[AI] Fetching suggestion...` - Request in progress
- `[AI] Suggestion applied` - Completion successfully inserted
- `[AI] Failed to fetch completion` - Generic error
- `[AI] Request timeout` - API timeout (try again)
- `[AI] Rate limit exceeded` - Too many requests
- `[AI] Check API key configuration` - Authentication issue

## Recent Improvements

- **ðŸ¤– AI-Powered Autocompletion**: Added intelligent code completion using Groq's LLM API with support for multiple models (Mixtral, LLaMA3)
- **Enhanced Character Display**: Fixed issues with special characters like quotes (`"`) and other symbols to ensure they display correctly
- **Improved File Saving**: Added more reliable file saving functionality, ensuring directories exist before saving
- **Theme Cycling Shortcut**: Added `Ctrl+t` shortcut to quickly cycle through available themes
- **Proper HTML Entity Decoding**: Characters are now properly decoded for display in the editor

## Syntax Highlighting

VimJS supports comprehensive syntax highlighting for 30+ programming languages, including:

- JavaScript/TypeScript/JSX/TSX
- Python
- C/C++
- Java
- HTML/CSS/SCSS/LESS
- Ruby
- Go
- Rust
- PHP
- Shell scripts (Bash, Zsh)
- Markdown
- JSON/YAML/TOML
- SQL
- and many more!

### Language Detection

VimJS automatically detects languages based on:

1. File extension (`.js`, `.py`, `.cpp`, etc.)
2. File content (shebang lines, language-specific patterns)
3. Filenames (like `Dockerfile`, `.bashrc`)

### Color Themes

Available color themes:

- `dracula` - Dark theme with vibrant colors (default)
- `nord` - Cool blue-based color scheme
- `tokyo-night` - Dark theme inspired by Tokyo at night
- `one-dark` - Atom-inspired dark theme
- `solarized` - Classic solarized dark theme

Change the theme with:

```
:cs theme-name
```

or

```
:colorscheme theme-name
```

### Performance Optimizations

For large files, VimJS uses optimized highlighting to maintain editor responsiveness.
