## Installation

Install globally from npm:

```bash
npm install -g vimjs
```

Or install from the repository:

```bash

```

### AI Autocompletion Setup

To enable AI-powered code autocompletion:

1. Get a free API key from [Groq Console](https://console.groq.com/keys)
2. Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env`:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
3. Edit `.env` and add your Groq API key:
   ```
   GROQ_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
   ```

## Usage

```bash
# Open a file (creates it if doesn't exist)
vimjs filename.txt

# Open untitled buffer
vimjs
```

5. Press `Esc` at any time to cancel and return to Normal mode

### Changing Editor Theme

You can change the theme using either:

1. **Command Mode**: Enter command mode with `:` and type `cs <theme-name>` or `colorscheme <theme-name>` and press Enter.
   Example: `:cs dracula`

2. **Keyboard Shortcut**: Press `Ctrl+t` in normal mode to quickly cycle through all available themes.

## AI-Powered Code Autocompletion

VimJS now includes intelligent code autocompletion powered by Groq's large language models.

### Features

- **Context-aware suggestions**: Analyzes up to 50 lines or 800 characters before the cursor for optimal performance
- **Intelligent preview mode**: Shows suggestions as faded gray ghost text inline before accepting
- **Multi-language support**: Works with any programming language
- **Smart caching**: Caches recent completions for faster responses
- **Multiple models**: Support for LLaMA3 and other Groq models
- **Graceful error handling**: Handles rate limits, timeouts, and network issues
- **Debounced requests**: 300ms delay prevents excessive API calls while maintaining responsiveness
- **Enhanced cursor feedback**: 
  - Insert mode: Blinking vertical bar (|) cursor
  - Normal mode: Steady block (‚ñà) cursor
  - Visual synchronization between cursor and buffer content
- **Auto-scroll**: Cursor remains visible when scrolling through files

### Usage

1. **Setup**: Configure your Groq API key in the `.env` file
2. **Ghost Text Autocompletion**: In Insert mode, AI suggestions appear automatically as clearly visible dim gray text after a 300ms typing pause
3. **Accept Suggestions**: Press `Tab` to accept grayed-out AI suggestions  
4. **Continue Typing**: Keep typing to dismiss current suggestion and trigger new ones
5. **Manual Trigger**: Press `Tab` when no preview is visible to request new suggestions
6. **Toggle**: Use `:toggleAI` to enable/disable the feature
7. **Status**: Use `:ai` to check configuration and status
8. **Models**: Use `:aimodel <model-name>` to switch between models

### Supported Models

- `llama3-8b-8192` (default) - Fast and efficient for code completion
- `llama3-70b-8192` - Most capable but slower
- `llama-3.1-8b-instant` - Latest Llama 3.1 model, very fast
- `llama-3.1-70b-versatile` - Latest large model, most capable
- `gemma-7b-it` - Good balance of speed and quality
- `gemma2-9b-it` - Improved Gemma model

### Status Messages

- `[AI] Suggestion ready (Tab to accept, type to dismiss)` - Preview suggestion available
- `[AI] Suggestion applied` - Completion successfully inserted  
- `[AI] Fetching suggestion...` - Request in progress
- `[AI] Failed to fetch completion` - Generic error
- `[AI] Request timeout` - API timeout (try again)
- `[AI] Rate limit exceeded` - Too many requests
- `[AI] Check API key configuration` - Authentication issue

2. File content (shebang lines, language-specific patterns)
3. Filenames (like `Dockerfile`, `.bashrc`)

### Color Themes

Available color themes:

- `dracula` - Dark theme with vibrant colors (default)
- `nord` - Cool blue-based color scheme
- `tokyo-night` - Dark theme inspired by Tokyo at night

Change the theme with:

```
:cs theme-name
```

or

```
:colorscheme theme-name
```

### Performance Optimizations
